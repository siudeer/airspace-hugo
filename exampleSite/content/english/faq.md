#### 1. How do you capture, collar, and process the deer?

Captures are made by graduate students using clover traps on SIU’s campus in areas where deer are most likely to be found (Thompson Woods, around Campus Lake, and on the west side of campus) in late April and early May. Corn is used to attract deer into the traps, where the traps are checked twice daily. When a deer is captured, the deer is immobilized using a fully reversible drug (BAM). Each captured deer is fitted with a GPS collar which has a battery life of approximately 2 years. These collars also have a dropoff mechanism that is programmed to release the collar from the animal after that period. The collars weigh less than 1 lb meaning that these collars weigh less than 1% of deer body mass. We capture deer in a similar manner at other sites around Illinois. 

#### 2.How do you capture, collar, and process the bobcats and coyotes? 

Bobcats and coyotes have been trapped and collared each winter since 2018 at SIU’s Touch of Nature Environmental Center, located south of campus, as well as on public land around Lake Shelbyville, located about 2.5 hours north of Carbondale. Bobcats are trapped using cage traps, which involves a bobcat entering a cage and triggering a mechanism which closes the door. Coyotes are trapped using foothold traps, which hold the coyote’s paw in place using rubber jaws after they step on the trigger hidden in the ground. Both trapping methods are very safe and leave the animal unharmed. Once a bobcat or coyote is trapped, the animal is sedated, our wildlife crew measures, weighs, collects demographic information, and fits the animal with a GPS collar, similar in design but smaller than the ones we put on deer. The predator collars drop off after one year. Once the animal’s sedation is reversed, it is free to go and collect location information for our GPS database!
