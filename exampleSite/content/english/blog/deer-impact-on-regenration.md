Have you seen a weird looking fence at Touch of Nature or in the Union Hill neighborhood?  Do not waste time trying to find what creature is being enclosed within these 100mÂ² fences. These are not enclosures, but actually exclosures. Their goal is to keep animal (here white-tailed deer) outside. Exclosures are one of the best way for evaluating the impact a species might have on the vegetation. White-tailed deer have been shown to impact vegetation community throughout their range, but these impacts are often difficult to quantify. These exclosures were setup in Fall 2020, so they have just been up for one year, but over the coming year, we expect to see a difference in the vegetation inside the exclosure relative to its surrounding. We'll make sure to report our findings here!.
