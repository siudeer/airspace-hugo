Hello, my name is Christian Gonzalez, and I am recent graduate from Southern Illinois University with a Bachelors in Zoology.

The project I was apart of involved the analysis of white-tailed deer around the Carbondale area to monitor and study their population distribution. I was apart of the both the field and lab work as I would go out into certain area around Carbondale along with my colleagues to find white-tailed deer fawns to collar and collect data from as they grew. This part of the project occurred during the end of May to the beginning of July. From here, I would move the project to the lab and work on a special part of the project where we compare the space use of normal white-tailed deer to that of an albino white-tailed deer we had managed to find and collar. Use the collected GPS data from their collars and utilizing ARCGIS, we were able to compare the various types of landcovers such as developed (urban) or forested areas and see if there were am significant differences between the two variations of deer.

From what we have found, there was indeed a significant difference between the albino and regular deer as the data pointed towards the albino utilizing more developed areas than the others suggesting that their interactions with humans is different if there are able to be more active in those areas.

Our project could be considered complete; however it is important to continue to the monitoring and study of deer movements and distribution in order to better improve our management and understanding of their behavior.
