  content: We are a group of researchers interested in understanding how behaviors
    such as movement affect animal populations. We study a variety of species found
    in Illinois (white-tailed deer, bobcat, coyotes, and beavers) and elsewhere (caribou,
    mule deer, elk, elephant, and giant tortoises). While our research centered around
    animal movement, we focus on the various implications  movement has on animal
    such as predator-prey interactions, migration, disease spread, and impact of human
    activities on their movement. Our research strives to improve our understanding
    of these species ecology while finding ways of ensuring a safe future for these
    species.
