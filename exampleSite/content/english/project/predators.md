#### Hi! We're the bobcats and coyotes of Illinois. We're important predators, keeping other animal populations in check. We can also affect deer by keeping them moving around to different areas. You may think of us as the villains of the deer's story, but you'll be lucky to spot us around campus! You can find many bobcats around the forests of southern Illinois and many coyotes around the fields and grasslands of central Illinois.
