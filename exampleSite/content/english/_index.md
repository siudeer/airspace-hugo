  content: 'Welcome to the Deer of SIU! We are tracking white-tailed deer around the
    SIU Carbondale campus to understand their movement and share them with SIU community.
    The GPS collars allow transmission of locations to servers that visualize animal
    movement, in almost real-time, allowing researchers and biologists to access an
    animal’s locations without disturbing or recapturing the animal. '

  title: WHERE DO DEER GO ON CAMPUS?
  content: "Southern Illinois possesses some of the highest abundance of white-tailed
    deer within the state, and deer can be easily observed around and within the city
    of Carbondale, including on Southern Illinois University’s campus. Deer behavior
    has been studied for a long time, but most studies have focused on deer behavior
    in rural areas, and much less is known about deer behavior and space-use in urban,
    suburban, and exurban areas.   \n\nWe hope to use these GPS data to better understand
    deer movement and space-use on SIU’s campus and increase awareness within the
    SIU community regarding natural resources and scientific research. Please see
    our FAQs page for more detailed information on how we capture and collar the deer
    and what we do with all the information we collect. Check out our maps of each
    individual deer to see their whereabouts and favorite hanging spots.  "
